1. Remove ability to change coordinates of hex
1. Thought going forward on this -- anything that uses text as it ID, e.g. "HEX" table, "0101" table entries, "animal" tag -- will not allow the text/ID to be edited. Or allow the record to be overwritten. Delete and create new, if needed.
1. No longer overwrite existing hex if new hex is added with same coordinates. Simply ignore the add.
1. Remove the otherTag=bool property from Tags. Instead, write some selectors: getTerrainTags(), getTerritoryTags(), getOtherTags()
1. getTerrainTags() get any tag that has a value in terrainHexes[]
1. getTerritoryTags() get any tag that has a value in territoyHexes[]
1. getOtherTags() get any tag that has no value in terrainHexes[] or territoryHexes[]
1. Allow deletion of other tags, which completely removes them from the store. I.e. no checking of "do they still have terrains/territory hexes?"
1. Intention is that once we have table entries with relations to tags, deleting an other tag would also remove all the tags relations off those table entries
1. Still allow terrain/territory to be edited on a hex, but doing so does not delete the tag. Just removes that hex from the tags' terrainHexes[] territoryHexes[]. The tag might become an "Other Tag", at which point it can be manually deleted.
1. Selectors around everthing! No longer have connectStateToProps directly returning state. No longer expect UI to known the shape of the store.
1. Add some helper functions for common immutable actions on stores. arrayWithItemAdded(), arrayWithItemAddAtIndex(), objectWithKeyRemoved(), etc. Basically put some consistency around the various newState = {...state, foobar} stuff.
